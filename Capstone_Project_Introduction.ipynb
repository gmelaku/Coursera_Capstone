    "Global warming and climate changes are existential threats to human race. The rate at which warming takes place is much faster than the Permian-Triassic extinction warming event. Extreme warming events always involve the same invisible culprit, one we’re familiar with today: A massive dose of carbon dioxide, or CO2.  With this rapid growth in technology; rapid industrialization and the race for being economic superpower, CO2 emission had increased exponentially. \n",

With the number of vehicles increasing at this rate, it is recommended to drive environmentally safe vehicles. In this project, the 2020 office of Energy efficiency & renewable energy guide data ( https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml)  will be used to create a model predicting if a given vehicle falls within the category of SmartWay vehicle."
